<!-- What is promises -->
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. 
A Promise is in one of these states:
.pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
.fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
.rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
